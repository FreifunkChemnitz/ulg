ULG development version 0.1
- development started in June 2012
- sponsored by CZ.NIC (http://www.nic.cz)
- intention is to create a versatile Looking Glass for various routers
- genshi and cherrypy was used in the beginning
- cherrypy was later dropped and simple CGI was used instead

Basic instalation procedure is:

1) install prerequisites: Python 2.6 or 2.7, Genshi, Python CGI module, urllib,
   pexpect and pygraph and GraphViz
2) deploy files in src directory to some place in WWW tree
3) cp config.py.example config.py
4) edit config.py to set up routers and credentials
5) edit defaults.py to set up correct paths
6) create .htaccess file with following contents:

<FilesMatch "(.pyc|.*~)">
  Deny from all
</FilesMatch>

Options +ExecCGI
AddHandler cgi-script .py

(Or use corresponding config of your web server.)

7) access http://yourserver/path-to-ulg/index.py via browser
8) change strings and templates in defaults.py and templates/*.html .

Procedure for Debian Squeeze/Wheezy and Linux Mint 14 (nadia):
1)
apt-get install python python-pexpect python-pygraph python-genshi libgv-python whois

All other steps are the same as in generic case.

Future plans:

This "pre-release" is only a preview and "technology demonstrator". Requests and contributions are welcomed. I indend to support BIRD (http://bird.network.cz) and Cisco routers and switches and support typical BGP-related commands and also IGP and L2 management commands in order to make LG more useful for ordinary NOC staff especially for information aquisition during outages and problems.
