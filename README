ULG development version 0.1
- development started in June 2012
- sponsored by CZ.NIC (http://www.nic.cz)
- intention is to create a versatile Looking Glass for various routers
- genshi and cherrypy was used in the beginning
- cherrypy was later dropped and simple CGI was used instead

Basic instalation procedure is:

1) install prerequisites: Python 2.7, Genshi, Python CGI module and pexpect
2) deploy files in src directory to some place in WWW tree
3) edit config.py to set up routers and credentials
4) edit defaults.py to set up paths
5) create .htaccess file with following contents:

<FilesMatch "(.pyc|.*~)">
  Deny from all
</FilesMatch>

Options +ExecCGI

(Or use corresponding config of your web server.)

6) access http://yourserver/path-to-ulg/index.py via browser

Future plans:

This "pre-release" is only a preview and "technology demonstrator". Requests and contributions are welcomed. I indend to support BIRD (http://bird.network.cz) and Cisco routers and switches and support typical BGP-related commands and also IGP and L2 management commands in order to make LG more useful for ordinary NOC staff especially for information aquisition during outages and problems.
